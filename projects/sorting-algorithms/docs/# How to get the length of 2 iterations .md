# How to get the length of 2 iterations ago????

## TODO:

- [x] 1. Start pushing in pairs of 3 ( start, end, length ) instead of in pairs of 2 ( start, end )

- [x] 2. Use r8 to pop out currently unused/non-necessary info (such as start index, after the left side where only the right start meaning the left end and the length as the new right end matter)

- [x] 3. IMPORTANT: PRESERVE 3-pair PUSH STACK DISCIPLINE

- [ ] 4. Don't reuse rdi as the midpoint calculation
